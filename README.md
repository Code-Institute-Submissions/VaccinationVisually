# Vaccination, Visually
 History of vaccination displayed as a timeline

 [See the live demo here:](https://ronanmc99.github.io/VaccinationVisually/)
 
 This project is an educational single-page website for those interested in the history of vaccination.  I was inspired by the award-winning website www.historyofvaccines.org, provided by The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which does a fantastic job of representing the known history of events related to vaccination in visual form. 

My aim was to provide an interactive timeline similar to the above.  This allows the user to see the key events in the history of vaccines, learn about some of the discoveries & people involved, and in doing so, increase their knowledge and understanding of how vaccines work and the role they play in public health.

##Project requirements

1. Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.

2. The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

Main Technologies:
Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

###Libraries:

[Vis.js - this provides an interactive chart for visualising data on a timeline.](https://visjs.github.io/)

[Moment.js - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript](https://momentjs.com/)

[Handlebars.js - HTML templating for timeline items](https://handlebarsjs.com/)

Data are stored in a JSON object with options configured in the vis timeline custom js.

###Use Cases
As a student of Biomedical Science, I have recently become very interested in vaccination and recognise that a resource like this can be very useful to other students, parents of young children and educators in this field.

Possible use cases include:
Students who are learning about the history of vaccination and want to increase their knowledge around the subject.
Students who are preparing to write a research paper and want both an overview of the history and additional information about key events.
Teachers or lecturers who are teaching students about vaccination and the key events that occurred during its history.
Parents who are interested in vaccination as it relates to their children and want to understand the subject more deeply.

##UX
-The user experience is about communicating information about the history of vaccination in a clear and simple way so that it can be a useful educational resource.

-The experience should make it very easy for me to interact with the data - for example, scrolling through the timeline, clicking on an item to learn more about it, or to filter events.  

-I want to be able to interact with the site with minimal prompting, however, if I require instruction on how to interact with the site, it should be obvious how to do so.

-As a user, I am seeking information and want to be able to find that information quickly, clearly and intuitively, so that the site becomes an effective learning or reference resource.

-As a user, I want to be able to see historical events on a timeline to that I can see the various scientific advances across the years, and get a feel for how quickly or slowly these advances happened, and where they key moments in history occurred.

-As a user, I should be able to easily see and differentiate the various types of event.  One possible use case would be a student preparing to write a paper on a given disease - if I were only interested in events related to that disease, then it should be obvious that I can filter these.

-By clicking on an event, I want to be able to get additional information about that event.  An example would be a hover-over item or tooltip containing text, images or a link.  This would allow the timeline to act as a hub, or a starting point for research or discussion.

-A scroll feature on the timeline will allow the user to see the specific date range they are interested in.  This also makes the information contained within more readable, as otherwise it could become crowded.

-Timeline date indicators should therefore be clearly visible.

-Site navigation will be minimal, serving to provide additional information about the main timeline content - for example data sources and references.  This provides a cleaner interface which is easily readable on an overhead projector during a presentation or when making notes.

-I want to be able to view the timeline on a variety of devices, whether mobile, tablet or desktop.

-I want to see visual images incorporated within the timeline as this can help with understanding the event, provide talking points for discussion or to aid in recall, if this were used in a research situation

Design - using these requirements, a wireframe was created in Balsamiq mockups 3, then a colour scheme was chosen before creating a prototype in Sketch.

##Installation

##Contribution

I would like to develop this project in the future to make it more useful for students and teachers.  If you would like to make a code contribution, a user-experience contribution, or suggest new timeline items, please contact me at:
